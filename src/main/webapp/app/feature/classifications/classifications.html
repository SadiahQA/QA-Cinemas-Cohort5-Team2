					Films under this category are considered to be unsuitable for young children.
					Cinemas in the United Kingdom are only permitted to supply tickets to see a 12A film to children under the age of 12 if they are accompanied by an adult aged 18 or over.
					However, it is unlikely to be suitable for children under the age of 12.

					Films under this category can contain mature themes, discrimination, soft drugs, moderate language, moderate violence, sex references and nudity.
					Sexual activity may be briefly and discreetly portrayed. Use of strong language may be permitted based on frequency and how they are used, as well as contextual justification.
					Sexual violence may be implied or briefly indicated.</div>

					12A-rated films are usually given a 12 certificate for the VHS/DVD version unless extra material has been added that requires a higher rating.

					Films under this category do not have limitation on the foul language that is used.
					Hard drugs are generally allowed, and explicit sex references along with detailed sexual activity are also allowed.
					Scenes of strong real sex may be permitted if justified by the context (Sex works cannot be placed at "18"). Very strong, gory, and/or sadistic violence is usually permitted.
					Strong sexual violence is permitted unless it is eroticized or excessively graphic, in which a work will require compulsory cuts where possible.</div>
